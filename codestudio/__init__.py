r"""The `codestudio` module contains all the <http://studio.code.org>
challenges and code to complete, extend, and add to them. Each challenge
is created in JSON and stored in `challenges`. Students complete the
challenges by completing the missing portions of the stub `py` files for
each challenge and then running them until they succeed. Challenges can
also be created using the `challenge.save(fname)` method. Successful
completions can optionally be reported to any accessible web site
supporting the `codestudio.progress` web API.

The only dependency is that standard Python 3 be installed from
<http://python.org>. This absence of other dependencies is by design to
best enable students, teachers, and developers to get up and running as
quickly as possible. This module requires only Python 3 with `tkinter`
and the standard sound libraries for each operating system from Multimedia
Services as described on <https://docs.python.org/3/library/mm.html>.

The implementation in `tkinter` has been abstracted away sufficient to be
replaced by other graphics libaries. This also allows the model itself to
be used to teach object-oriented programming without the distraction of
the graphics package implementation, which can later be taught through
its use as a graphics engine for this project. It also allows the base
`codestudio` domain and object model to be easily ported between different
object-oriented languages.
