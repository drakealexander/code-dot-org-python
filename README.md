Code.org, Python Style
======================

Often coding is about creative expression, but not always. Sometimes the
working world demands coders &mdash; especially juniors &mdash; to create
something based on a given set of requirements.  Porting code created by
dragging and dropping Blockly on [studio.code.org](http://studio.code.org)
to hand-written Python based on the JavaScript revealed by the  *Show
Code* button builds on the fun and skills while learning to 'code to spec'
in a third programming language.

This repo contains code stubs for all of the challenges from
the Introduction to Computer Science organized by the unique
identifier in the URL for each challenge. The solutions are
loaded from `challenges` allowing everything to be done without
needing code.org or even to be online, but looking back at completed
[learn.code.org](http://learn.code.org) activities will help. Python's
clean, curly-free syntax means that the count of lines of code directly
translates to number of blocks allowed from the puzzles.

Students fork this repo or download the zip (to the right on github.com) and
complete the challenges with a vanilla installation of Python on their local
computer. The results of their code solutions is checked against a saved
solution (in JSON format) in the `challenges` directory.

Detailed descriptions of the sections of each ported Python file are
embedded as comments in these examples.

As students progress in their porting to more complicated challenges
that require use and creation of functions they put them into their own
version of the `mymod` module file.

Finally students can create their own `extra` challenges
for themselves and others by contributing to the [extra
collection](http://github.com/skilstak/code-org-python/tree/master/extra),
which may eventually become its own site to students to challenge
each other.
