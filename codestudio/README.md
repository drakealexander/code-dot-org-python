codestudio
==========

A Python module to supplement and expand studio.code.org learning
activities and [code-dot-org](http://github.com/code-dot-org) with a focus
on initially typing out code 'ports' of the JavaScript from 'Show Code'
in each activity.

If you are a student you probably want to just fork
[code-org-example](http://github.com/skilstak/code-org-example), (which
includes this `codestudio` module as a submodule), instead of forking
this one.

This is a Python module so it can simply be forked and/or included in
other projects simply as a submodule. Either of these should work in
your own repos:

```
git submodule add git@github.com:skilstak/codestudio.git`
git submodule add http://github.com/skilstak/codestudio.git`
```

For testing and other distribution forms see the
[codestudio-project](http://github.com/skilstak/codestudio-project) repo.
