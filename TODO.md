TODO
====
* Line joiner multiple small lines in same direction into one longer line
    * Green glasses (s1level30) fails for some who use less than one line
    * Rather than log the artist rotations, infer the new rotation
      for each line drawn in the order in the log (asin, acos) and
      incorporate into speed and options calculations so this does not
      slow down extremely higher speed playbacks
* Add Artist sprites
* Puzzle backgrounds
* Puzzle canvas decoration images
* Sound
* Maze
* Farmer
* Add stages for OOP introduce classes, objects, methods and attributes
* Lines of code counter
* Hint system
    * Basic parse code with reg expressions
    * Pluggable so others can contribute
    * History of hints shown
    * Basic markup for text color and formatting
